#  Your line length is ...

#### What is this
A tool to calculate a rough line measure (average number of characters per line) for a given font/size/line width. It's been been knocking around on my hard disk for ages and I thought I'd make it public.

#### Why?
Line measure can effect readibility. There's lots of research on this, but have a look at this for starters,
http://www.webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Horizontal_Motion/2.1.2/

It bugs me that I see so many sites online with uncomfortable line measures. Maybe making something like this public might raise awareness.

#### What will be done?
* Add touch events
* Add Hash states to the url so you can link to a setup.

#### What won't be done?
* Line height controls: this isn't a typesetting tool.
